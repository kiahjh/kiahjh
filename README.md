### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend developer and designer that puts on his full-stack hat when the need arrises. Based in Wadsworth, OH.
Currently mostly working on [Gertrude](https://gertrude.app), a macOS internet safety and website blocking app, as well as [Friends Library](https://friendslibrary.com), a small non-profit dedicated to making the writings of the early Society of Friends generally available for free.

On top of this I also have a handful of ongoing side projects, including the following:
- [The Ancient Path](https://hender.blog) - writings and teachings of Jason R. Henderson
- [Canoe Creation](https://canoecreation.org) - showing youth the glory of their Creator through outdoor canoeing trips, rappelling trips, etc.
