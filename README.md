### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend developer and designer that puts on his full-stack hat when the need arrises. Based in Wadsworth, OH.
Currently mostly working on [Gertrude](https://gertrude.app), a macOS internet safety and website blocking app, as well as [Friends Library](https://friendslibrary.com), a non-profit dedicated to making the writings of the early Society of Friends generally available for free.

On top of this I also have a handful of ongoing open source projects, including the following:
- [devine](https://github.com/kiahjh/devine) - delightful dev tools for react
- [next-bg-image](https://github.com/kiahjh/next-bg-image) - responsive, optimized, and accessible background image component for Next.js apps
